# Persistent Reverse Shell

This repository, featuring tools for establishing persistent and encrypted reverse shell connections, is designed for several specific scenarios, particularly in the fields of cybersecurity, IT systems administration, and ethical hacking. Here are some potential use cases:

**Remote System Administration**: IT professionals managing servers or other remote systems may use this tool for maintaining access for troubleshooting and system updates, ensuring they can always connect even if standard access methods fail.

**Educational Purposes**: Students and instructors can use this tool in cybersecurity courses to demonstrate and learn about reverse shells, network security, and encryption techniques in a controlled environment.

**Penetration Testing**: Ethical hackers and penetration testers can utilize this tool to simulate attacks on systems (with proper authorization) to identify vulnerabilities in network security, testing how well the system can withstand unauthorized access attempts.

**Red Team Exercises**: In cybersecurity exercises, red teams (offensive security) can use this tool to test the effectiveness of the blue team's (defensive security) response strategies and incident handling by establishing persistent connections to "compromised" systems.

**Research in Cybersecurity**: Researchers analyzing malware behavior, reverse shell techniques, and encryption can use this tool as a reference or a base for developing more advanced cybersecurity tools and strategies.

**Security Demonstrations**: Security consultants might employ this tool to demonstrate to businesses and organizations the potential risks and implications of reverse shell attacks and the importance of encryption and secure configurations.

It's crucial to emphasize that this tool is intended for legal and ethical use only. Unauthorized use of reverse shells and similar tools can be considered illegal and unethical in many jurisdictions. Always ensure you have explicit permission to use these tools in any network or system.

# Contents
**setup.sh**: A Bash script that installs required Python packages, sets up **persistence.py** as a system service for automatic startup, and executes **encrypt.py** to generate encrypted configuration.

**persistence.py**: A Python script that establishes a reverse shell connection to a specified server, automatically reconnecting every 20 seconds if the connection is lost.

**encrypt.py**: A Python script that prompts the user for connection details (LHOST and LPORT), encrypts this information using a provided key, and saves the encrypted data for **persistence.py** to use.

**uninstall.sh**: Stops and disables the persistence service and timer, removes related files and directories, and suggests manual cron job removal, ensuring a clean uninstallation.

# How to Use
**Setup Environment**: Run **setup.sh** to install dependencies, copy scripts, and set up the systemd service. This script will prompt you for an encryption keyâ€”make sure to remember it as it is required for decrypting connection details.

**Configure Connection**: When running **setup.sh**, you will be prompted to enter **LHOST** and **LPORT** for your reverse shell connection. This information will be encrypted and saved.

**Service Management**: The **persistence.py** script is set up as a systemd service, ensuring it starts on boot and attempts to reconnect every 20 seconds if the connection drops.

# Customization
**Changing IP Address and Port After Initial Setup**

To modify the IP address and port used by the tool after the initial setup, simply re-run the **encrypt.py** script, providing the new details along with the same encryption key used initially. This ensures that your updated settings remain secure and encrypted.

**Cleanup Options**

Beyond network settings customization, the installation script offers options to perform cleanup after installation or uninstallation is complete:

**Deleting the persistentshell Directory**: At the end of the installation, you will be asked whether you wish to delete the current directory **persistentshell**. This is useful for keeping your environment clean and removing any residual files from the installation process.

**Clearing Terminal Command History**: Along with the option to delete the directory, the script also offers the possibility to clear the terminal's command history. This action will remove all previously stored entries in the command history, providing an additional layer of privacy.

# Recommendations

Always review the settings and options available before running the script to ensure you understand the actions that will be performed.
Remember to keep the encryption key used safe and accessible for future customizations or updates to the settings.

# Disclaimer
This tool is designed for educational and testing purposes only. The creator strictly discourages and disclaims any responsibility for its use in unauthorized or malicious activities. Always obtain explicit permission before deploying this tool in any environment.
