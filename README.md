# Persistent Reverse Shell for Linux
This repository contains scripts for setting up a persistent reverse shell connection. The connection utilizes encrypted configuration for enhanced security. It is designed to automatically restart and attempt reconnection at regular intervals, ensuring persistent access.

# Contents
**setup.sh**: A Bash script that installs required Python packages, sets up **persistence.py** as a system service for automatic startup, and executes **encrypt.py** to generate encrypted configuration.

**persistence.py**: A Python script that establishes a reverse shell connection to a specified server, automatically reconnecting every 20 seconds if the connection is lost.

**encrypt.py**: A Python script that prompts the user for connection details (LHOST and LPORT), encrypts this information using a provided key, and saves the encrypted data for **persistence.py** to use.

# How to Use
**Setup Environment**: Run **setup.sh** to install dependencies, copy scripts, and set up the systemd service. This script will prompt you for an encryption keyâ€”make sure to remember it as it is required for decrypting connection details.

**Configure Connection**: When running **setup.sh**, you will be prompted to enter **LHOST** and **LPORT** for your reverse shell connection. This information will be encrypted and saved.

**Service Management**: The **persistence.py** script is set up as a systemd service, ensuring it starts on boot and attempts to reconnect every 20 seconds if the connection drops.

# Customization
To change the IP address and port after initial setup, rerun **encrypt.py** with the new details and the same encryption key.
